//Soak test is determine to:
/*
- Verify that your system doesn't suffer from bugs or memory leaks, which result in a crash or restart after several hours of operation.
- Verify that expected application restarts don't lose requests.
- Find bugs related to race-conditions that appear sporadically.
- Make sure your database doesn't exhaust the allotted storage space and stops.
- Make sure your logs don't exhaust the allotted disk storage.
- Make sure the external services you depend on don't stop working after a certain amount of requests are executed.
